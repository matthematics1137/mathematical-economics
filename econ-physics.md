# Economics ↔ Physics Analogy (with Key Figures)

A lineage-style study guide mapping layers of economics to layers of physics, with representative thinkers.

---

## **Newtonian Mechanics ↔ Classical Optimization**
- **Physics:** Deterministic motion, fixed laws, solved with calculus.
- **Economics:** Classical optimization — agents maximize utility/profit subject to constraints.
- **Examples:** Consumer choice, firm production, Solow growth, Ramsey model.
- **Key figures:**
  - **Lionel McKenzie, Gérard Debreu, Kenneth Arrow** — general equilibrium, optimization rigor.
  - **Robert Solow** — exogenous growth (passive).
  - **Frank Ramsey, David Cass, Tjalling Koopmans** — intertemporal optimization (active).
  - **Kevin Lancaster** — consumer demand theory, “general optimizing problem.”

## **General Relativity ↔ Institutional / Structural Economics**
- **Physics:** Curved spacetime; the *background itself* evolves with mass-energy.
- **Economics:** Institutions, technology, history bend the “geometry” of feasible choices.
- **Examples:** Endogenous growth, institutional economics, multiple equilibria, path dependence.
- **Key figures:**
  - **Paul Romer, Robert Lucas** — endogenous growth theory (knowledge spillovers, human capital).
  - **Douglass North, Daron Acemoglu, James Robinson** — institutions as constraints.
  - **Brian Arthur** — path dependence, increasing returns.
  - **W. Brian Arthur & Paul David** — QWERTY/path dependence.

## **Quantum Mechanics ↔ Game Theory & Information Economics**
- **Physics:** Probabilistic states, uncertainty, superposition; outcomes depend on observation.
- **Economics:** Strategic interaction under incomplete information, probabilistic beliefs.
- **Examples:** Nash equilibrium, mechanism design, Bayesian games, rational expectations, stochastic control.
- **Key figures:**
  - **John Nash** — equilibrium concept.
  - **John Harsanyi, Reinhard Selten** — refinements, incomplete info.
  - **Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, Roger Myerson** — mechanism design.
  - **Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent** — rational expectations revolution.
  - **Robert Shiller** — behavioral departures under uncertainty.

---

## **Statistical Mechanics ↔ Complexity & Emergence**
- **Physics:** Ensemble behavior, distributions, emergent macro laws.
- **Economics:** Many interacting bounded-rational agents generate emergent macro dynamics.
- **Examples:** Econophysics, complexity economics, agent-based models, network contagion.
- **Key figures:**
  - **Herbert Simon** — bounded rationality, near-decomposability.
  - **Santa Fe Institute (W. Brian Arthur, John Holland, Murray Gell-Mann)** — complexity economics.
  - **Econophysics pioneers (Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Rosario Mantegna)** — power laws in finance.
  - **Mark Granovetter, Duncan Watts, Matthew Jackson** — networks & contagion.

---

## **Grand Unification ↔ Modern Frontiers**
- **Physics:** Attempts to unify GR + QM.
- **Economics:** Attempts to integrate optimization, uncertainty, and emergence into one framework.
- **Examples:** DSGE, mechanism design, AI-agent economics, complexity synthesis.
- **Key figures:**
  - **Finn Kydland, Edward Prescott** — real business cycle theory (DSGE roots).
  - **Olivier Blanchard, Michael Woodford** — modern DSGE & monetary policy.
  - **Alvin Roth** — applied mechanism design, market design (kidney exchange, school choice).
  - **AI + RL researchers** applying machine learning to economics (new frontier).
  - **Agent-based/complexity hybrid work** (post-Santa Fe).

---

## **Other Possible Analogies**
- **Thermodynamics ↔ Political Economy / Resource Constraints**  
  Energy, entropy, resource flows as macro-constraints on all optimization. (Georgescu-Roegen, ecological economics.)
  
- **Quantum Field Theory ↔ Financial Markets / Continuous-Time Models**  
  High-frequency trading, stochastic calculus (Itô, Black–Scholes, stochastic differential equations).

- **Information Theory ↔ Economic Decision-Making**  
  Claude Shannon-inspired approaches to bounded rationality, rational inattention (Chris Sims).

These are less “mainline” but worth keeping in the mental map.
