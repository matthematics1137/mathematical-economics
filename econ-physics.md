# Economics ↔ Physics Analogy

A study guide mapping layers of economics to layers of physics.

---

## **Newtonian Mechanics ↔ Classical Optimization**
- **Physics:** Deterministic motion, fixed laws, solved with calculus.
- **Economics:** Lancaster’s framework — maximize utility/profit subject to constraints.
- **Examples:** Consumer choice, firm production, Solow growth (passive), Ramsey model (active).
- **Key tools:** Lagrangians, convexity, calculus of variations, control theory.

---

## **General Relativity ↔ Institutional / Structural Economics**
- **Physics:** Gravity as curvature of spacetime; the *background itself* evolves.
- **Economics:** Institutions, technology, and history shape the “geometry” of feasible choices.
- **Examples:** Endogenous growth (Romer, Lucas), institutional economics (North), path dependence, multiple equilibria.
- **Key idea:** The constraint set is not fixed — it bends and evolves with the system.

---

## **Quantum Mechanics ↔ Game Theory & Information Economics**
- **Physics:** Probabilistic states, uncertainty, measurement changes outcomes.
- **Economics:** Strategic interaction under uncertainty; beliefs and information matter.
- **Examples:** Nash equilibrium, Bayesian games, mechanism design, rational expectations, stochastic optimization.
- **Key idea:** Agents live in probability clouds of strategies and beliefs, not certainty.

---

## **Statistical Mechanics ↔ Complexity & Emergence**
- **Physics:** Don’t track each particle; study ensembles and emergent distributions.
- **Economics:** Many interacting bounded-rational agents → emergent macro patterns.
- **Examples:** Econophysics (power laws of wealth/firm sizes), agent-based models, complexity economics (Santa Fe Institute), network contagion in finance/trade.
- **Key idea:** System-level laws emerge from micro-level heterogeneity and interaction.

---

## **Grand Unification ↔ Modern Frontiers**
- **Physics:** Attempts to unify GR and QM.
- **Economics:** Attempts to unify optimization + uncertainty + emergence.
- **Examples:** DSGE models (mainstream macro unification), mechanism design (engineered incentives), AI + reinforcement learning agents, econ complexity + networks.
- **Key idea:** Bring together deterministic optimization, probabilistic strategy, and emergent dynamics into one framework.
