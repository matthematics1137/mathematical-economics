Roadmap
=======

Principle: move deliberately, emphasize structure and understanding first. We will expand into programs/simulations later.

Initial focus (landing page only)
---------------------------------
- [x] Create landing page with four sections
- [x] Establish shared CSS and typography
- [x] Document repository scope and conventions
- [x] Prepare `pages/` for future outlines (keep empty for now)

Upcoming (content scaffolding, no programs yet)
-----------------------------------------------
- Draft outlines for:
  1) Optimizing Theory (convexity, KKT, duality)
  2) Static Economic Models (consumer/producer, welfare)
  3) Dynamic Economic Models (difference/differential eqs, stability)
  4) Mathematical Reviews (LA, analysis, probability, numerics)
- Add references/reading lists per section
- Add crossâ€‘links to relevant chapters/notes

Later (interactive expansions)
------------------------------
- Lightweight interactive illustrations where helpful
- Incremental demos aligned to the reading cadence
