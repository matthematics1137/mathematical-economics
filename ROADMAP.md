Roadmap
=======

Guiding principle: small, focused, interactive pages that make concepts tangible. Check items off as pages ship.

Planned pages (initial wave)
---------------------------
- [x] Consumer theory — Indifference curves (`pages/consumer_indifference.html`)
- [x] Demand — Cobb–Douglas (`pages/cobb_douglas_demand.html`)
- [x] Production — Isoquants & Isocost (`pages/production_isoquants.html`)
- [x] Cost minimization (stub) (`pages/cost_minimization.html`)
- [x] Exchange — Edgeworth box (stub) (`pages/edgeworth_box.html`)
- [x] General equilibrium — Tâtonnement (stub) (`pages/walras_tatonnement.html`)
- [x] Game theory — Best responses (stub) (`pages/best_response_dynamics.html`)
- [x] Growth — Solow (stub) (`pages/solow_growth.html`)
- [x] Macro — IS–LM (stub) (`pages/islm.html`)
- [x] Input–output — Leontief (stub) (`pages/input_output.html`)

Follow‑ups and enhancements
---------------------------
- Budget constraints on indifference page; MRS tooltip; multiple utility levels
- Cobb–Douglas: Engel curves, price offer curves, Hicksian vs Marshallian
- Production: cost minimization with MRTS = w/r marker; expansion path
- Edgeworth: dual indifference maps, contract curve, core, price lines
- Tâtonnement: excess demand functions, stability conditions, phase plots
- Best responses: payoff matrix editor, fictitious play option
- Solow: phase diagram, transition path, golden rule, TFP shocks
- IS–LM: comparative statics and policy scenarios; AD–AS link
- Input–output: 2×2 or 3×3 matrix editor, solve (I-A)^{-1} d, viability checks

Nice‑to‑have
------------
- Shared tiny JS helpers for axes, scales, and simple plotting
- Dark mode toggle with CSS variables
- Export current chart as PNG/SVG
