# definition of optimization
- **optimization** - catch all term for maximizing, minimizing, or finding a saddle point 
	- a **decision maker** (individual, firm, gvt) chooses values of some variables to maximize / minimize an *objective function*, subject to some constraint(s)
		- **objective function** - what we are optimizing for 
		- **choice variables** - what can be adjusted 
		- **constraints** - what we cant adjust (limits imposed by reality)
- mathematically:
	- $max_{x \in X}$, $f(x)$ $s.t.$ $g(x) \leqslant b$ 

# passive vs active economic models 
- **passive model** - the system evolves automatically according to constraints once conditions are set (ex solow growth model)
- **active model** - system with *agents* that make *choices* in order to optimize
	- policy instruments or control variables are actively adjusted to steer outputs 
	- ex ramsey growth model

# efficient growth paths 
- **path** - a time sequence of variables (consumption $c_t$,$ capital $k_t$)
	- an **efficient** growth path is one where you cannot reallocate resources to make one agent better off without making another worse off 
		- *dynamic extension of pareto efficiency*
