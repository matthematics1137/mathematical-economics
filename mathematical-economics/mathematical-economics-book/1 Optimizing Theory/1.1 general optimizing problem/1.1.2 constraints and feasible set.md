# what is a feasible set
- technically the feasible set can be anything, but in economics we generally look at equalities and inequalities *between the variables*, whose relationships are considered the constraints 
	- *in practice* we mean the feasible set can be 'any real world values' but we *generate* them by looking at all values which are valid under all constraints of the system
		- *for example* we may have a constraint that only positive values are valid for the system 

# constraint types and properties 
- constraints can be thought of in terms of *taxonomies*, where each type has properties specific to it:
	- **form** - how its written
		- **equality** $h_i(x)=0$ cuts the feasible set to a *surface*
		- **inequality** $g_j(x) \leq 0$ carves out a *region*
		- **bounds** $l \leq x \leq u$ 
		- **linear v nonlinear:**
			- *linear* gives *polytopes* (a *convex* hull of finitely many points)
			- *nonlinear* gives *curved regions*
	- **time** - dynamics
		- **state v control** - 
		- **path constraints** 
		- **boundary terminal**
		- **integral / average**
	- **information** - 
		- **explicit** - direct, written as *equalities/inequalities*
		- **implicit** - indirect, defined through another relation or domain
			- ex: $y \iff (x,y) | y \leq F(x)$ 
		- **hard v soft:**
			- **hard** - must hold in feasible set
			- **soft** - enforced via *penalties/regularizers* in the objective


- **feasible region** - the area of the space where values are valid according to the constraints generated by the feasible set

- **interior point** - given a point in the set, if all points that comprise its *neighborhood* are part of the feasible set, the point is said to be *interior*
- **boundary point** - given a point in the set, if its neighborhood is comprised of points both *inside and outside* the feasible set, the point is said to be a *boundary* 
	- generally one of the constraints will actually define the boundary 
		- ex: $x_{1}^2 + x_{2}^2 - k^2 = 0$ 

- **closed set** - a set is said to be closed if it is generated by a *weak inequality* ($\leq$ weak here referring to the fact that we take less than OR equal to) we can easily see the 'closed' aspect of this when thinking about a set $x \leq 1$ we have an upper bound for the set, a 'final value' in the form of 1, contrast this to:
- **open set** - $x < 1$ we call this set 'open', generated by a *strict inequality* ($<$ demands entities of the set be less than a certain value) because of the infinite nature as we approach 1. we can always come up with a larger number that gets us closer to 1 without ever reaching it
- ⭐ please note that this is different from **bounded** (the set is finite) and **unbounded** (the set is infinite) which is different from the open set because an open set we could draw a *finite* bound around 1 to close the set, whereas in an unbounded set we *cannot* 'draw a *finite* bound around infinity' 

# feasible sets 
- **closed & bounded (*compact*)** - boundary points are included and they are finite so we can draw a finite 'ball' around it
- **open & bounded** - boundary points are not included but the space itself can be contained in a finite 'ball'
- **closed & unbounded** - boundary points are included but extend infinitely in some direction
- **open & unbounded** - boundary points are excluded, and the set extends infinitely

- **effective at** $x*$ - we say the constraint is effective at x if it gives an *equality*, by definition it **cuts the feasible set down to a lower dimensional surface**
	- inequalities *may or may not be effective* depending on where the *optimum* lies 
	- an equality can be 'effective' in reducing the set, but not reducing the dimension (this is what makes the definition)
