# what is a feasible set
- technically the feasible set can be anything, but in economics we generally look at equalities and inequalities *between the variables*, whose relationships are considered the constraints 
	- *in practice* we mean the feasible set can be 'any real world values' but we *generate* them by looking at all values which are valid under all constraints of the system
		- *for example* we may have a constraint that only positive values are valid for the system 

# constraint types and properties 
- constraints can be thought of in terms of *taxonomies*, where each type has properties specific to it
