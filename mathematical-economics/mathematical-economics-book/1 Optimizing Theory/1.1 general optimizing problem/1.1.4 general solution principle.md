# general solution principle
- the solution $max [or \ min]f(x)$ for some $x$ over some *closed feasible set* $k$ will, if it exists, be some point $x^*$ which is:
	- a *critical point* $f(x)$ **OR**
	- a *boundary point* of $k$ **OR BOTH**
- **closed feasible set** - the optimal value *if it exists* necessarily must be in the acceptable range of values where its boundary is also included
- **critical point** - a point where the *gradient* of the objective vanishes:
	- $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$, where $\nabla f(x)$ (the gradient) is the *vector* of all *partial derivatives*
		- each partial derivative measures the slope of the objective function in the direction of one variable (holding the others fixed) 
- **boundary point** - a point where the neighborhood includes some points *not* in the feasible set 
	- so what we are saying is:
		- the *optimal solution*, if it exists, exists within the set of valid points which includes its own boundary, where the *slope of all its partial derivatives are equal to zero*, or, it exists *on the boundary*

- the optimal point may either be an *interior point* or a *boundary point* (neighbors are inside or it exists on boundary)
	- for interior points:
		- **it *must* be true that the optimal point is also optimal relative to its neighbors**
			- *a critical point inside the feasible set if always a candidate for local max/min, but we have to check this to determine it is a global optimum*
- this is slightly tautological (the only two kinds of points in a closed set are interior or boundary) 
	- the purpose has more to do with defining what a critical point is, that it is optimal AND interior (otherwise of course it is on boundary)
		- **the significance is that from the interior the gradient condition is necessary, on the boundary we use different machinery** ⭐ (not covered yet)

- we can compute an optimal point by computing gradients of values of interior points then all boundary points, but this generally too great a task, so we use **ad hoc**
	- ⭐ if $f(x)$ is not differentiable everywhere, the points at which it is not differentiable will need to be examined as well
