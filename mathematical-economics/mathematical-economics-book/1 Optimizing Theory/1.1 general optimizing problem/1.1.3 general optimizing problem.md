- $max$ $f(x)$, $x = [x_j]$, $j = 1,...,n$
	- $x$ is a vector of $n$ variables for the problem (capital, labor, land, etc. whatever variable we want to maximize)
- **such that...**
- (1) $g^i(x) \leq 0$, $i = 1,...,m$ 
	- these are our *functional constraints* - relationships between variables
	- ***this gives us the shape of the thing we want to study***
- (2) $x_k \geq 0$, $k \in S$, $S \subset 1,...,n$ 
	- these are *direct constraints* - logical necessities when dealing with the real world (for ex can not have negative land)
	- $S$ is a *subset* of the variables we are optimizing, for each direct constraint for the given variable we *impose* non-negativity 
	- ***this ensures the mathematical shape of the thing we want to study conforms to reality***
- ⭐ one may wonder how we can determine that these always are greater or less than eq to zero, this is because we are defining these constraints in **standard form** which is the canonical way of writing optimization problems
	- *math machinery can be applied directly*
	- *we don't need to continuously re-derive equations*
		- for example a budget:
			- $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 \leq I$
			- can be *rewritten in standard form as:*
			- $g(x) = p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 - I \leq 0$
			- so we can always make $\leq$, $\geq$ $0$ by moving the RHS to LHS
			- ⭐ note that *standard* and *canonical* form are different, we turn in to canonical by adding a *slack variable* (the leftover budget)
				- canonical = everything expressed as equalities
				- $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + s = I$, $s \geq 0$

- we define this in the maximum case, but can be minimum as well, just take $min(-f(x))$
	- ***the point that makes f(x) as large as possible will make -f(x) as small as possible***
- the choice of maximum over minimum fits more naturally with economic problems 

- ⭐ "the inequalities in both the functional and direct constraints are assumed to be weak inequalities to ensure that the feasible set is closed" -- translation --
	- the relationship between the variables defining the mathematical and physicalized shape of the problem are assumed to include boundary points, so that maxima and minima can be found
- **optimum problems need not have solutions, but we are sure that *many* problems are worth attempting...**


# weierstrass's theorem
- **a continuous function defined over a nonempty closed bounded set attains a maximum and minimum at least once over the set:**
	- **nonempty** - values exist
	- **closed** - a boundary exists (there are values x with neighborhoods which contain points outside the feasible set)
	- **bounded** - we can draw a 'circle' around the set, guaranteeing the function does not run off to infinity into any direction
	- **continuity** - without holes or jumps (is smooth) ⭐ without this we could have *supremum/infimum* that can never be touched (imagine the function disappears for minima or explodes to infinity outside of the set)
- ⭐ ***these conditions are sufficient but not necessary***
	- even without these conditions we may still find an optimum


- generally continuity and closure are given for the objective function, so we need to check the boundedness
	- *generally this is not something we can determine without studying*
