Conventions for This Repository
===============================

Scope: Applies to the entire repository.

Goals
-----
- Keep the site lightweight and dependency‑free (plain HTML/CSS).
- For now, focus on the landing page and structure only (no programs yet).
- Prefer clarity and pedagogy over maximal generality.

Structure
---------
- `index.html` — Landing page organizing the four parts.
- `pages/` — Reserved for future outlines/notes.
- `assets/css/style.css` — Shared styles. Keep inline styles to a minimum.

Page guidelines (later)
-----------------------
- Use the shared stylesheet and the common container classes (`.container`, `.buttons`, `.button`, `.back`).
- Start with a brief 1–2 paragraph description; keep math simple and link out for depth.

Roadmap
-------
- Maintain planned topics and checkboxes in `ROADMAP.md`. Keep it up to date as pages are added.
