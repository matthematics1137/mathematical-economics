Interactive, dependency‑free pages that make core concepts in micro, macro, optimization, and growth tangible. Inspired by Kelvin (Kevin) Lancaster’s Mathematical Economics and adjacent texts. Each page is a small, focused demo designed for exploration in the browser.

Highlights
----------
- Clean, static site — no frameworks, just HTML/CSS/JS
- Self‑contained topic pages that load instantly
- Visual, parameter‑driven intuition for standard models
- Consistent styling, accessible defaults, lightweight code

Demos
-----
- Live site: https://matthematics1137.github.io/mathematical-economics/
- Featured pages:
  - Consumer Theory: Indifference Curves — `pages/consumer_indifference.html`
  - Demand: Cobb–Douglas — `pages/cobb_douglas_demand.html`
  - Production: Isoquants & Isocost — `pages/production_isoquants.html`
  - More planned in `ROADMAP.md`

Structure
---------
- `index.html` — Landing page linking to topics
- `pages/` — Individual topic pages (standalone HTML files)
- `assets/css/style.css` — Shared, lightweight styles used by all pages
- `AGENTS.md` — Working conventions and code style
- `ROADMAP.md` — Planned topics and status

Roadmap
-------
Planned enhancements and upcoming topics are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`.

Acknowledgments
---------------
- Influenced by the clean, dependency‑free structure used in the sibling `chaos/` repository.
- Inspired by the pedagogy of Kelvin Lancaster and the broader mathematical‑economics literature.
