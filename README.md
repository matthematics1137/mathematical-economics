Concise, dependency‑free study notes inspired by Kelvin (Kevin) Lancaster’s Mathematical Economics and adjacent texts. We are intentionally not rushing into simulations; the initial focus is clear structure and outlines we’ll expand together.

Highlights
----------
- Clean, static site — no frameworks, just HTML/CSS/JS
- Clean typographic layout; accessible defaults
- Consistent styling; lightweight code and assets
- Clear progression we will build on together

Scope
-----
- Live site: https://matthematics1137.github.io/mathematical-economics/
- Four parts (landing page only for now):
  1) Optimizing Theory
  2) Static Economic Models
  3) Dynamic Economic Models
  4) Mathematical Reviews

Structure
---------
- `index.html` — Landing page linking to topics
- `pages/` — Reserved for future outlines/notes (empty for now)
- `assets/css/style.css` — Shared, lightweight styles used by all pages
- `AGENTS.md` — Working conventions and code style
- `ROADMAP.md` — Planned topics and status

Roadmap
-------
Planned enhancements and upcoming topics are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`.

Acknowledgments
---------------
- Influenced by the clean, dependency‑free structure used in the sibling `chaos/` repository.
- Inspired by the pedagogy of Kelvin Lancaster and the broader mathematical‑economics literature.
